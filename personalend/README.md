# Personal End

Having someone defeat the dragon and loot the end long before you get there is annoying, so I've made a mod for that. You each have your own End!

We generate a new End for each player upon entering the End for the first time, so you get your own dragon fight! It's a shame to get the the end of the game and not have your climactic boss battle.

If you want to take the dragon on together, don't worry: if you follow someone into the portal, you'll go to their End too!

Once you've reached the End, you'll unlock the `/end` command:
- `/end shared` - go to the shared End
- `/end visit` - go to your own End
- `/end visit <player>` - go to a player's End (that player must have generated their own already)

This mod is currently for Minecraft version 1.20.1 with Fabric.
